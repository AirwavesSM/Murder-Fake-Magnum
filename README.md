# Murder Fake Magnum (EN)
Attention!!! This addon is designed and works only in the Murder gamemode.

## Description
Adds a "Fake Magnum" weapon to the game, which is automatically issued to the killer at the beginning of each round. It looks exactly like a regular magnum, but has much less damage than the original, which allows the maniac to pretend to be an eyewitness with a secret weapon.

## Settings/Console commands
### Server
 * mu_fakemagnum_lootneed [0/15] - the required amount of evidence to obtain a fake magnum (max 15)
 * mu_fakemagnum_lootneed_multiplier [0/1] - whether to issue a weapon for every X evidence specified by the command above or the same issue once (1 - yes, 0 - no)
 * mu_fakemagnum_give on start [0/1] - whether to issue weapons at the beginning of the round (1 - yes, 0 - no)
 * mu_fakemagnum_autoselect [0/1] - will the magnum be automatically handed out after receipt (1 - yes, 0 - no)
 * mu_fakemagnum_damage [0/500] - weapon damage (to apply, you need to restart the server)
### Client
 * mu_halo_render [0/1] - whether to display an outline around all objects of the Murder mode (1 - yes, 0 - no) - Standard Murder command, supported by the addon
 * mu_halo_fake magnum [0/1] - whether to display an outline around a fake magnum (1 - yes, 0 - no)
